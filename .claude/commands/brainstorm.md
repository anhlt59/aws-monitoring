# Brainstorming Session

I'll facilitate a structured brainstorming session. This mode encourages:

- **Divergent thinking** - Generate many ideas without immediate judgment
- **Creative exploration** - Consider unconventional approaches
- **Question-driven discovery** - Ask probing questions to uncover insights
- **Multi-perspective analysis** - View problems from different angles

## Process

1. **Understand the Challenge**: Clearly define what we're brainstorming about
2. **Generate Ideas**: Propose multiple solutions without filtering
3. **Explore Variations**: Build on ideas and explore alternatives
4. **Evaluate Feasibility**: Assess practicality, effort, and impact
5. **Synthesize**: Combine the best elements into actionable proposals

## Brainstorming Techniques

- **SCAMPER**: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse
- **6 Thinking Hats**: Facts, Emotions, Cautions, Benefits, Creativity, Process
- **First Principles**: Break down to fundamental truths and rebuild
- **Analogy**: Draw parallels from other domains
- **Reverse Thinking**: What would make this worse? Then invert it.

What would you like to brainstorm about?

I'll help you explore possibilities, ask clarifying questions, and guide the session toward actionable insights while considering:
- The hexagonal architecture of this project
- AWS serverless constraints and capabilities
- Cost, performance, and maintainability trade-offs
- Implementation complexity and timeline
