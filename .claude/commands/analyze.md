# Deep Analysis Mode

I'll perform a comprehensive analysis of the specified topic. This command provides:

- **Systematic investigation** - Methodical examination of all relevant aspects
- **Data-driven insights** - Analysis based on code, metrics, and evidence
- **Multi-dimensional view** - Technical, architectural, and operational perspectives
- **Actionable recommendations** - Specific, prioritized suggestions for improvement

## Analysis Types

### Code Analysis
- Code quality and maintainability
- Design patterns and anti-patterns
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Test coverage gaps
- Technical debt assessment

### Architecture Analysis
- Layer separation and dependencies
- Hexagonal architecture compliance
- AWS service usage and optimization
- Scalability and reliability
- Cost analysis
- Security posture

### Performance Analysis
- Lambda cold start times
- DynamoDB capacity and throttling
- API response times
- EventBridge delivery latency
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Bottleneck identification

### Issue Analysis (Root Cause)
- Error pattern recognition
- Log correlation and timeline
- Hypothesis testing
- Dependency analysis
- Impact assessment
- Fix recommendations

## Analysis Process

1. **Scope Definition**: What should be analyzed?
2. **Data Gathering**: Collect relevant code, logs, metrics
3. **Investigation**: Apply analysis techniques
4. **Findings**: Document observations and issues
5. **Recommendations**: Provide prioritized actions
6. **Next Steps**: Suggest implementation plan

What would you like me to analyze?

Please specify:
- **Target**: What to analyze (file, module, feature, issue)
- **Focus**: Specific aspects to examine (performance, security, architecture)
- **Context**: Any background or constraints
- **Goals**: What you hope to learn or achieve
