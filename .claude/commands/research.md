# Research Mode

I'll conduct thorough research on the specified topic. This command provides:

- **Comprehensive investigation** - Deep dive into documentation, patterns, and practices
- **Multiple sources** - AWS docs, best practices, community knowledge
- **Contextual relevance** - Findings applied to this project's architecture
- **Practical recommendations** - Actionable insights for implementation

## Research Areas

### Technology Research
- AWS services and features
- Python libraries and frameworks
- Testing tools and methodologies
- Monitoring and observability solutions
- Security tools and practices

### Pattern Research
- Architectural patterns (hexagonal, event-driven, CQRS)
- Design patterns (repository, factory, strategy)
- AWS patterns (fan-out, saga, circuit breaker)
- Database patterns (single-table, GSI usage)
- Testing patterns (fixtures, mocks, integration)

### Best Practices Research
- AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Serverless best practices
- Python best practices (PEP standards)
- Security best practices (OWASP, AWS)
- DevOps and CI/CD practices

### Solution Research
- Problem-solving approaches
- Alternative implementations
- Tool comparisons
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Migration strategies

## Research Process

1. **Define Research Question**: What do we need to know?
2. **Gather Information**: Search codebase, documentation, and knowledge base
3. **Analyze Findings**: Evaluate relevance and applicability
4. **Synthesize**: Combine insights into coherent recommendations
5. **Present**: Deliver findings with examples and next steps

What would you like me to research?

Please specify:
- **Topic**: What to investigate
- **Purpose**: Why you need this information
- **Constraints**: Any limitations or requirements
- **Depth**: How comprehensive should the research be

I can research:
- AWS service capabilities and pricing
- Python package options and comparisons
- Architecture pattern trade-offs
- Best practices for specific scenarios
- Solutions to technical challenges
- Integration approaches and examples
