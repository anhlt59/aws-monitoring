# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

## PRIME DIRECTIVE

    Avoid working on more than one file at a time. Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
    Follow Hexagonal Architecture principles. Use a consistent coding style throughout the project.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE

    When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
    1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
    2. Your plan MUST include:
       - All functions/sections that need modification
       - The order in which changes should be applied
       - Dependencies between changes
       - Any potential risks or issues
       - A summary of the overall goal of the changes

## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN

    Working with: [filename]
    Total planned edits: [number]

<!-- ### MAKING EDITS

    - Focus on one conceptual change at a time
    - Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
    - Include concise explanations of what changed and why -->

### EDIT SEQUENCE:

    1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
    2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
    3. Do you approve this plan? I'll proceed with Edit [number] after your confirmation.
    4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making ANY edits when user ok edit [number]

### EXECUTION PHASE

    - After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress:
    	"âœ… Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
    - If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
    - STOP and update the plan
    - Get approval before continuing

### REFACTORING GUIDANCE

    When refactoring large files:
    - Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
    - Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
    - Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
    - Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied

### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE

    - For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
    - Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
    - Always provide clear stopping points
